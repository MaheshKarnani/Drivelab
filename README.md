## Mission
We study how the brain controls behaviour. In particular, we are currently focused on how long-range inputs into the hypothalamus control instinctive behaviours like feeding. Our ongoing work is uncovering operational principles of cortical control of the lateral hypothalamus [Razenberg et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.15.623801), and motivational switching [Hartmann et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.24072/pcjournal.416).

The lateral hypothalamus has limited local circuitry - to the point of not containing any microcircuitry of the type we are used to seeing in the cortex. You can read more about this in our previous work: [Burdakov & Karnani 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.07.061) and [Karnani et al. 2016](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.037).

These findings have been replicated by other investigators in hypothalamic areas including lateral hypothalamus by [Shao et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.05.029), and the neighbouring subthalamic nucleus by [Steiner et al 2019](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1642-18.2019).

Because of this lack of local circuitry, it is important to find out what long-range input is coming into the hypothalamus. In the absence of local processing, upstream processing and the functional identity of input sources is everything.<br>

## Values
We believe that sharing information and minimizing access barriers is necessary to: 
1. maximize the rate of progress in neuroscience
2. increase the efficiency of research spending
3. include all people with skills whether or not they are priced out from using the techniques they are skilled at

To achieve these goals, we:
1. Share new information and tools as soon as we have found them.
2. Preprint, publish and read for free; decrease expending time and money on an [inefficient system of communication](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.230206); contribute to ways of decoupling evaluation and dissemination from commercial publishing.
3. Use, create and promote affordable tools.

Therefore, we participate in [open design](https://www.researchequals.com/maheshkarnani), [open data](https://osf.io/yb67q/), [open peer-review](https://neuro.peercommunityin.org/articles/rec?id=1), [diamond open access](https://peercommunityjournal.org/articles/10.24072/pcjournal.416/), [preprinting](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.15.623801v1) and [grass-roots community building](https://prelights.biologists.com/profiles/mahesh-karnani/).
