We study how the brain controls behaviour. In particular, currently we are focused on how long-range inputs into the hypothalamus control instinctive behaviours like feeding. More specifically, our ongoing work is uncovering operational principles of cortical control of the lateral hypothalamus, and motivational switching. Read more in our latest paper, [Hartmann et al 2024](https://doi.org/10.24072/pcjournal.416)

The lateral hypothalamus has limited local circuitry - to the point of not containing any microcircuitry of the type we are used to seeing in the cortex. You can read more here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.07.061 http://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.037

These findings have been replicated by other investigators: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.05.029 https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1642-18.2019 

Because of this lack of local circuitry, it is important to find out what long-range input is coming into the hypothalamus. In the absence of local processing, upstream processing and the functional identity of input sources is everything...
